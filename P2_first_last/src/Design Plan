Design Plan - P2
Due 3/12/25 11:59 pm

Plan: 
learn 3d array
use scanner to read row by row and insert into a 2d/3d array, store multiple levels in a 3d array
	ignore noise (go by given row x col)

create a storage 2d array for possible paths, find the best path through fewest steps, put that into a queue/stack for wolverine to respond to
make a coordinate converter (may change if I can figure out a visualization) to put it into a 2d or 3d (if more than one) array
add a runtime measurer 
Coordinate de-converter for output, put output in a 2d array to be printed
